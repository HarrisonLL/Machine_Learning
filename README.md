# Machine_Learning
This folder includes summaries of typical machine learning method and data processing techniques.
Notes are mainly summarized from EECS 545 (Machine Learning) and STATS 503 (Statistical Learning) at 
the University of Michigan.
I will keep updating while learning new tech in ML.

1) The ML.txt file is a short but sweet summary.
2) The PDF file includes necessary summary and algorithm details.
3) The NLP.txt: I am also trying to summarize some NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques here that I know.
4) The DL&NLP pdf file includes my notes from a previous internship. It summarizes some advanced deep learning models such as LSTM, transformers, and BERT. The use case is NLP tasks. My understanding, however, is not in detailed.
