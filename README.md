# Machine_Learning
This folder includes summaries of typical machine learning method and data processing techniques.
Notes are mainly summarized from EECS 545 (Machine Learning) and STATS 503 (Statistical Learning) at 
the University of Michigan.
I will keep updating while learning new tech in ML.

1) The "ML.txt" file is a short but sweet summary, including model pros and cons.
2) The "Machine Learning Notes .pdf" includes necessary summary and algorithm details.
3) The "NLP_basics_summary.txt" summarizes some basic NLP tasks such as text cleaning, document similarity, and basic ML usage.
4) The "Deep Learning and NLP.pdf" file includes modern deep learning techniques and more advanced models suchas LSTM, transformers, and BERT. It also includes some models that I built and researched during my internship in 2021.
