# Machine_Learning
This folder includes summaries of typical machine learning method and data modeling techniques.
Notes are summarized from EECS 545 (Machine Learning) and STATS 503 (Statistical Learning) from 
the University of Michigan.
I will keep updating upon I finish the courses.

> The ML.txt file is a short but sweet summary.
> The PDF file includes necessary summary and algorithm details.
> The NLP.txt: I am also trying to summarize some NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques here that I know.
