# Machine_Learning (keep updating)
This repo includes summaries of traditional machine learning models (math, pros & cons), data preprocessing techniques, and deep learning models.
Notes are mainly summarized from EECS 545 (Machine Learning) and STATS 503 (Statistical Learning) at the University of Michigan. It also includes studies out of school.

1) The "ML.txt" file is a short but sweet summary, including model pros and cons.
2) The "Machine Learning Notes .pdf" includes algorithm details.
3) The "NLP_basics_summary.txt" summarizes some basic NLP tasks such as text cleaning, document similarity, and basic ML usage.
4) The "Deep Learning and NLP.pdf" file includes deep learning techniques such as LSTM, transformers, and BERT. 
   It also includes some models that I researched and built during summer internship in 2021.
